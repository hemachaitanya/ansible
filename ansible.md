### ansible facts

### Handlers: running operations on change

* Sometimes you want a task to run only when a change is made on a machine.

For example:
 you may want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service, but not if the configuration is unchanged. Ansible uses handlers to address this use case. Handlers are tasks that only run when notified.

 ### Inventory
Inventory in Ansible represents the hosts which we need to connect to.

Ansible inventory is broadly classified into two types

* static inventory:
 where we mention the list of nodes to connect to in some file

* Static inventory can be mentioned in two formats

            * ini 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#:~:text=An%20INI%20file%20is%20a,sections%20that%20organize%20the%20properties.>

            * yaml
<https://github.com/asquarezone/AnsibleZone/commit/9dd91ff1e6d12bd912927737f8f445a3284a39bf>

* dynamic inventory: 
where we mention some script/plugin which will dynamically find out the nodes to connect to

###  Facts

* ansible collects information about the node on which it is executing by the help of module called as setup

* Ansible playbook by default collects information about nodes where it is executing, we can use this with the help of variables

* Collecting information can be disabled as well

---
- name: do some thing
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  ...
  ...
---

* In the playbook the facts will be collected and will be available in a special variables " ansible_facts " as shown in the below play book

---
- name: facts will be available
  hosts: all
  become: no
  tasks:
    - name: print OS details
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "hemachaitanya"
        var: ansible_default_ipv4
    - name: same info
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: ansible_facts["default_ipv4"]
